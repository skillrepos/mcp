# mcp
Repository for Understanding MCP (Model Context Protocol) - A hands-on guide 

These instructions will guide you through configuring a GitHub Codespaces environment that you can use to run the code. 

**1. Click on the button below to start a new codespace from this repository.**

Click here ➡️  [![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/skillrepos/mcp?quickstart=1)

**2. Then click on the option to create a new codespace.**

This will run for a long time (10 or more minutes) while it gets everything ready.

After the initial startup, it will run a script to setup the python environment, install needed python pieces, install Ollama, and then download the models we will use. This will take several more minutes to run. It will look like this while this is running.

When the setup is done, you may see a prompt to press a key like this.

The codespace is ready to use when you see a prompt like the one shown below in its terminal.

**3. Open the labs file.**

You can open the labs.md file either in your codespace or in a separate browswer tab/instance.**

**4. Change your codespace's default timeout from 30 minutes to 60 or more.**
To do this, when logged in to GitHub, go to https://github.com/settings/codespaces and scroll down on that page until you see the *Default idle timeout* section. Adjust the value as desired.
